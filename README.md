# Coinbase.Global

##Overview and Origin

Coinbase Global was founded by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. It was incorporated on June 20, 2012. The idea of the company came about when Brian was having difficulties buying Bitcoin(BTC). Their vision was to make cryptocurrencies more easily accessible to the general public and also provide a secure platform for people to participate in the digital currency ecosystem. That's when the opportunity came up to create a platfom for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies. Coinbase received $500+M over 13 rounds from various sources including Venture Capital Firms, Strategic Partners and Private Investors. This helped support its growth and operations.

##Business Activities

Coinbase is addressing various financial problems by being more accessible, secure and understood by the broader audience. Their intended customers include individual retail investors, experience traders, institutional investors, businesses and developers. They also target people who may be unbanked or underbanked. Their market is substantial and has potential for more growth as cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance. Coinbase offers a user friendly interface, strong security(very important), regulatory compliance and a wide range of supported assets to their audience. They have a strong emphasis on security and have inplemented robust security measures to their platform throughout the years. They're implementing technology through a combination of software, security measures and operational practices to operate its exchange and wallet services. Their current technologies include Blockchain technology, cold storage, cloud services, API's(Application Programming Interfece) and mobile app developmen.

##Landscape

Coinbase falls in the Cryptoccurrency or digital assets domain. There has been alot of trends and innovations in cryptocurrency in thse last 5-10 years. They include Bitcoins Dominance, Ethereum and smart contracts, layer 2 solutions, stablecoins, Defi and NFT's. Binance, Kraken, Gemini, Bitstamp, Solana and Ripple are also included in this Domain

##Results

Coinbase has had huge mainstream adoption and global reach and have become an inspiration for some competitors. They measure success by keeping track revevenue and profits, Market Cap, trading volume, transaction counts, liquidity and active wallets. Coinbase is the largest exchange in the United States and currently holds a Market Cap just shy of $20B. Revenue in the past year come around $2.7B. Coinbase has the most assets under management on its platform($220+B). This liquidity gives them power to provide superior pricing and trade execution.

##Recommendations

I feel like coinbase should offer an even more extensive seletion of assets. Some competitors offer more and one way to catch up is by continuously adding(LETS BECOME #1). In my opinion this will bring more retail investors to their platform. We will have to utilize blockchain integration, wallet integration and smart contract integration for it to work. By doind this we will be able to record and verify every trade and transfer of assets on a blockchain. This transparency will only enhance out trust with our audience.
